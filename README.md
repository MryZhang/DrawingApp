Drawing App
======

This Drawing App has no functional purpose by itself; it is an experiment of complexity management to test how much requirements (and maybe future requirements) I can mash together by designing software properly. I'm not quite sure if I was successful, but it was still to date the most complex piece of work I've created.

Technically this app will compile in any OS that Qt 5 supports, given you have a C++11 compliant compiler. I heavily rely on lambdas, foreach loops, auto, some smart pointers and other C++11 goodness. 

This app has been tested in Windows 8.1 (MSVC++2013) and Manjaro Linux (MinGW 4.8).
